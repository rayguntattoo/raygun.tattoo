## Abstract

This is an old static site a friend made years ago. In this project I fart around with modern tools to slowly convert a WYSIWYG generated static site into a modern static application.

This is easily my lowest priority for the foreseeable future, so this is likely to take a really long time.

Only Judy can judge me.

## Development

`npm run dev`

Cleans and builds `dist/` directory and then starts the webpack-dev-server on [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)
